# AlgoLite

### *But what's the need of Algolite ?*
C being a language which stands very close to the machine it's being compiled on (although is very strong) lacks some basic algorithms, and data structures that may make it very easy to use in hobby projects. This also includes some infrastructural libraries such as:
1. A logging library (with simple APIs to log program state at various level).
2. A timer library (to calculate time elapsed between two instances in the program with very high precision).
3. A csv reader/write library (will be helpfull if interfacing with languages such as python which populate csv file with data to process at higher speed).
4. And counting....

The library structure is not yet completely organised. I'll soon be making it compatiable with CMake too so that it's easier for someone to include in pre running projects.

### *What to do now ?*
If you're confused and wish to ask something please ping at Discussion section [here](https://github.com/UtkarshBhatthere/algolite/discussions). You are free to open a feature request/ Suggestion/ or even Bug reports (though we'll be glad if you do that [here](https://github.com/UtkarshBhatthere/algolite/issues)).

If you wish to checkout the code, just do that just clone our repo and start right away!

### *Coding Guidelines*
As this source code is openly available for anyone to use/ edit/ playwith, we have to bind ourselves with certain clean-coding guidelines (which is a good thing!). Nothing fancy in specific, just remember that you are not writing code for machines to use but for humans to use!.
